        <p>The article discusses the concept of digital counterpublics, which are rooted in the idea of subaltern counterpublics by Nancy Fraser. Fraser's concept challenges Habermas's notion of the public sphere, which historically excluded marginalized groups from participating in public discourse. Subaltern counterpublics are spaces where marginalized groups can develop oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs. These counterpublics can take various forms, such as Black barbershops, churches, and bookstores.</p>
        <p>With the expansion of digital technologies, virtual and online spaces have become new sites for subaltern counterpublics to be constituted, resulting in the formation of digital counterpublics. This shift is due to the rise of the internet, social networking websites, and the growing use of smartphones, which have allowed people to engage with technology in a wider range of contexts and practices. The formation of digital counterpublics is also influenced by neoliberal capitalism, which has eliminated or radically reconstituted traditional spaces of public engagement, such as bookstores and restaurants. </p>
        <p>As a result, digital counterpublics have become essential sites for 21st-century community, forcing us to reassess the role of spatiality and materiality in community formation, consider the possible sites for subaltern politics, and reconsider the role of digital epistemologies in everyday discourse and public pedagogy.</p>
        <p>The article then discusses the use of surveillance technologies by the US government to monitor and control its citizens, especially those belonging to Arab, Muslim, and South Asian communities. It also notes that the history of surveillance technologies in the US has a long tradition of monitoring, controlling, and disciplining Black bodies, which are perceived as being synonymous with criminality. However, with the advent of new technologies, Black youth are using smartphones and other devices to record interactions with law enforcement officials, which can then be distributed via social media without censorship. The article argues that such new surveillances enable Black citizens to hold State agents and institutions accountable for anti-Black violence and other forms of social injustice.
