        <p>The passage discusses the evolution of technology and the development of machines with interchangeable parts that are reliable and cost-effective to produce. Two centuries ago, Leibnitz invented a calculating machine with features similar to modern keyboard devices, but it was too expensive to construct and maintain, and complexity was synonymous with unreliability. Babbage also had a sound idea for an arithmetical machine, but construction and maintenance costs were too high. Today, machines like typewriters, movie cameras, and automobiles can be produced cheaply and reliably with interchangeable parts. Even delicate devices like the thermionic tube used in radio sets are now mass-produced for a low cost. The passage suggests that the age of cheap, complex, and reliable devices is leading to something significant in the future.</p>
        <p>It then discusses the challenges of accessing information stored in libraries due to the artificiality of indexing systems. The human mind operates by association, which is not easily duplicated artificially. The article proposes a future device called "memex," which is a mechanized private file and library that allows an individual to store all their books, records, and communications for easy and flexible access. </p>
        <p>The memex is a hypothetical device described by Vannevar Bush in 1945 that would allow users to create trails of information and quickly access them. The basic idea is that any item can be connected to any other item through associative indexing. The user can name a trail, insert it into a code book, and tap a button to permanently join two items together. Each item has a number of blank code spaces, and a set of dots is inserted in the code space to designate the index number of the other item. The trails can be reviewed rapidly or slowly by deflecting a lever, and any item can be joined into numerous trails. The owner of the memex can use it to build a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him and insert comments of his own. The trails do not fade, and can be accessed and shared with others.</p>
        <p>The text describes a future where a new form of encyclopedia, called the memex, will allow people to access vast amounts of information with associative trails to quickly navigate and amplify their knowledge. Different professions such as lawyers, patent attorneys, physicians, chemists, and historians will benefit from this technology. The author suggests that new technologies may arise to accelerate progress, and proposes the idea of directly transmitting information to the brain. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of using science to improve human life, despite the risks and challenges it presents.
